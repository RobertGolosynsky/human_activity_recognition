# Context recognition architectures project

The Android application allows for accelerometer data gathering, model training and running the model.
This helps to evaluate temporal data processing approaches and Weka models.

---
The application was developed in conjunction with a server. 
The server given the labeled data trains a classification model that is subsequently used by the app. 
The application is used for the collection of the training data and uses the server to store the data and train classification models. 
A list of trained models allows the user to fetch one model and experiment with different sized of training data and different mode.
